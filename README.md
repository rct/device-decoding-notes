# Device Decoding Notes

This repo is for sharing reverse engineering notes/analysis, primarily from consumer ISM/IR devices that I want to use as part of home automation projects.

Mostly this is to organize details that are spread across forums, github issues, gists, etc.

Currently most of my decoding is related to [rtl_433](https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433)


## Devices

* [Acurite 06045M Lightning detector](./acurite-6045-lightning)
